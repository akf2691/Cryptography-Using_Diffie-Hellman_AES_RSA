# Cryptography-Using_Diffie-Hellman_AES_RSA
A hybrid cryptographic system implementing Diffie-Hellman for key exchange, RSA for digital signatures and AES-256 for secure bulk data encryption.
Diffie-Hellman: To securely establish a shared secret between two parties over an insecure channel.
RSA:	To verify the identity of the parties (preventing Man-in-the-Middle attacks).
AES:	To perform the actual high-speed encryption of the message or file using the DH secret.
