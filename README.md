# Cryptography: Hybrid System (DH + RSA + AES)
This project demonstrates a secure communication flow using multiple cryptographic layers.

## Technical Workflow
1. **RSA**: Used for digital signatures to ensure the sender's identity is authentic.
2. **Diffie-Hellman (DH)**: Used for secure key exchange between two parties.
3. **AES**: Used for high-speed symmetric encryption of the actual data.

## How to Run
1. Open the `.ipynb` file in this repository.
2. Click the **"Open in Colab"** button at the top.
3. Run the cells to see the key exchange and encryption in action.
